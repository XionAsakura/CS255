# CS255
This repository contains my CS-255 Project Two: System Design Document and Client Presentation for the DriverPass system, completed as part of my coursework at Southern New Hampshire University. The project demonstrates my ability to design system models, document technical requirements, and communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
DriverPass is a proposed system designed to improve scheduling, training, and testing for student drivers. This project builds on earlier requirements gathering and focuses on system design, including UML modeling and client communication.
# Deliverables:
System Design Document
UML Use Case Diagram
UML Activity Diagrams (2)
UML Sequence Diagram (1)
UML Class Diagram
-Technical Requirements (hardware, software, tools, and infrastructure):
Client Presentation
System Requirements
Use Case Overview
Activity Diagram Walkthrough
Security Considerations
System Limitations
Designed for a non-technical client audience
-Tools & Technologies:
Lucidchart for UML diagrams
Microsoft Word & PowerPoint for documentation and presentation
System Analysis & Design principles for requirements modeling
-Skills Demonstrated:
Requirements analysis and translation into system models
